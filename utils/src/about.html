            <p>
              Creedlance.com is Nigerias largest Jobs and workers crowd
              sourcing marketplace. We connect businesses and people of what
              ever scale to their respective needs in the market place, be
              it a job, a worker or a service. We beleive any worker can be
              an employer and any employer can be a worker, as such
              creedlance prioritizes no exact type of service/job on her
              platform. From proffessional jobs to large scale
              projects/contracts or to laboured jobs concerning manpower,
              all categories can be found in Creedlance. We also do beleive
              that the Nigerian work and Job force can be sustained by
              itself, if we all are connected the right way.

                Creedlance began by pioneering a better way of working,
                assisting businesses in finding greater flexibility and
                connecting talent with greater opportunities in Nigeria
                (founded by Tonye Tex-Jack and Victory Okeke in 2023,

                Our mission of creating economic opportunities for people to
                live better lives has taken us a long way. As a result,
                we've evolved into the Nigeria's work marketplace, where
                every day businesses of all sizes and independent talent
                from around Nigeria come together to achieve incredible
                things.
